# Training Timer

### A simple timer with preset feature for creating multiple workouts.

<HeroImage image={TimerImg} title="Training Timer" />

Training Timer is a React-powered app that enables the user to create a workout from the get-go, or to create a preset. It's built using Redux Toolkit for advanced state management.

<br />

<TableOfContents h2Arr={['quick-workout', 'creating-a-preset']} />

<br />
<br />

<ArticleH2 id={'quick-workout'} text={'Quick workout'} />

Initial page (which can be seen above) offers some basic workout options: sets, work and rest. After user clicks the START button, workout timer screen will appear. Here user can skip the sets or pause his training.

<ArticleH2 id={'creating-a-preset'} text={'Creating a preset'} />

User has an option to create a preset quickly on the initial screen by pressing the SAVE button. They will see a modal which requires a name to be inputed. This workout will be created based on the initial screen data (sets, work and rest).

<br />
<br />

After creating a preset as shown above, or after clicking PRESETS button on the main page, user will be navigated to the presets page where all of their custom workouts are displayed. Here they will also have an option to create a new workout.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={TimerImg3}
   imageMobile={TimerMobileImg3}
   isResponsive={true}
   alt="Results screen"
/>

<br />
<br />

If they choose to create a workout in the presets page, they will be shown a seperate page that requires all the necessary data.

<br />

<ArticleImage
   image={TimerImg4}
   imageMobile={TimerMobileImg4}
   isResponsive={true}
   alt="Results screen"
/>

<br />
<br />

After setting workout parameters, user can commence their workout.
