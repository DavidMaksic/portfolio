First of all, only approved users can log in. Existing authors are the only ones who can create new authors. When new author wants to gain access to the site, they use a password provided by an existing author and, after they verify their e-mail address, they can log in.

<br />

Upon logging in, new author will see the dashboard page, which contains all the relevant information and statistics about the blog. Here user can see all the drafted articles that haven't been published yet.

There are a lot of options, such as choosing a title, description, category and image (which can be previewed); language can be set as well, which changes article's font. There is also a side config button on the right, which opens a small menu with theme, fullscreen and scroll options.
